Q1.1 -	A primary key uniquely identifies a column in a table while a foreign key links tables together which have a matching column.

Q1.2 -	The 'finally' block is used to finish off a 'try...except...else' block. The 'finally' block will always run, no matter what, even if errors are raised 
	in the 'try...excdept...else' block. It helps to close objects and clean resources.

Q1.3 -	The 'commit' command saves changes made to a file to your local repository, while the 'push command transfers the saved files to your remote repository.

Q1.4 -	AccuWeather is a free public API which requires an API key to access the data. It can be used to access a wide range of weather related data from all over
	the world. This data can be current, historical or a forecast for the days ahead.
	
	StarWars API (SWAPI) is a free public API that holds a large amount of data about the Star Wars Universe. This includes information on films, characters,
	planets, spaceships and programmes.

Q1.5 -	The product owner is responsible for:
	
	- Setting up the product vision
	- Handling the product backlog
	- Providing acceptance criteria
	- Managing stakeholders

Q1.6 -	A FULL OUTER JOIN shows all records where there is a match in either table. 
		
		SELECT column_name(s)
		FROM table1
		FULL OUTER JOIN table2
		ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name	

	An INNER JOIN shows all records which only have matching values in both tables.

		SELECT column_name(s)
		FROM table1
		INNER JOIN table2
		ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Q1.7 -	Mutable data types are objects which can be changed in Python code. 'Lists' and 'Directories' are examples of mutable data types as the data within the list or
	directory can be changed.

	Immutable data types are in-built in Python and cannot be changed once they have been created. 'Ints' and 'Strings' are examples of immutable data types.

	(Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutable-vs-immutable-objects-in-python/)

Q1.8 -	The 'Agile'approach is where there are no clear project requirements at the start, or the requirements are likely to change. This approach allows for continous
	and fast development and improvement.

	The 'Waterfall' approach is where there are a clear set of requirements at the very start and an ordered project plan is created which accommodates the requirements.

	Two differences between the 'Agile' and 'Waterfall' approach are flexibility and delivery time. Where the 'Agile' approach is flexible and testing is done at each 
	stage allowing the product to be released faster, the 'Waterfall' approach is very rigid and is not tested and released until it is working correctly.
