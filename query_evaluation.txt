SELECT
	patient_id,
	COUNT(*) AS admission_count
FROM
	admissions
WHERE
	department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Cardiology'
	OR department_name = NULL)
	AND admission_date >= '2015-01-01'
GROUP BY
	patient_id
ORDER BY
	admission_count DESC
LIMIT 1;


For the above code provided, in the WHERE clause, it should read department_name IS NULL and not department_name = NULL

The code also limits the answer to 1 patient. If the LIMIT was set to another number, you could check the top 10 patients or, you could remove the limit to show 
all the patients depending on what was required at the time.

The WHERE clause could also be changed to:
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Cardiology') AND admission_date >= '2015-01-01'
This will allow for other department ids to be included which may be associated with Cardiology.
